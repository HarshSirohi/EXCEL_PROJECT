# 🌾 Crops Production in Different States (1966–2017) - Excel Dashboard Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth **analysis and visualization of crop production across Indian states** from **1966 to 2017**, using Microsoft Excel's powerful features like **PivotTables, Charts, Slicers**, and **Dashboards**. The dataset, sourced from (http://data.icrisat.org/dld/src/crops.html), contains more than **16147 records** related to seasonal production of various crops in districts across India.

The goal of this project is to:
- Identify key trends in crop production over time.
- Highlight regional disparities in agricultural output.
- Enable dynamic visual exploration for better insights.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details

The cleaned dataset contains the following fields:
- `State`
- `District`
- `Year`
- `Season` (e.g., Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Winter, Whole Year)
- `Crop`
- `Area (Hectares)`
- `Production (Tonnes)`
- `Yield (Kg/Ha)`

**Data Source**: [ICRISAT / data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in)

## 📊 Features of the Dashboard

- Dynamic **filtering by year, state, season, and crop**
- Visual comparisons between **production and area cultivated**
- **Yield analysis** to evaluate agricultural efficiency
- Identification of **high and low performing regions**
- Excel charts including bar, line, and pie visuals for trends

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The dataset was cleaned through the following steps:

1. **Removed Duplicates**  
   Checked for duplicate entries; retained data integrity by analyzing column-wise redundancy.

2. **Filled Missing Values**  
   Blank or missing cells were replaced with `0.00` to ensure consistency.

3. **Handled Invalid Data**  
   Negative values (e.g., `-1`) were replaced with `0.00` using Find and Replace.

4. **Formatted Numbers**  
   All numeric fields were standardized to two decimal places for clarity.

5. **Trimmed Whitespace**  
   Leading/trailing spaces in `State` and `District` columns were removed using the `TRIM` function.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Punjab, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh** are consistent leaders in agricultural output.
- **Rice, wheat, and sugarcane** are among the top-performing crops.
- Significant variations in **yield** and **area utilization** highlight opportunities for agricultural development.
- Interactive Excel dashboards allow flexible and user-friendly data exploration.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **real-time crop data** using APIs
- Build **Geo-visualizations** using GIS tools
- Apply **Machine Learning** to predict future crop trends
- Migrate analysis to **Power BI or Tableau** for enhanced interactivity
